## Course Description
In CS 61A, we are interested in teaching you about programming, not about how to use one particular programming language. We consider a series of techniques for controlling program complexity, such as functional programming, data abstraction, and object-oriented programming. Mastery of a particular programming language is a very useful side effect of studying these general techniques. However, our hope is that once you have learned the essence of programming, you will find that picking up a new programming language is but a few days' work.

61A uses the Python 3 programming language. Python is a popular language in both industry and academia. It is also particularly well-suited to the task of exploring the topics taught in this course. It is an open-source language developed by a large volunteer community that prides itself on the diversity of its contributors.

In previous semesters, this course was taught using the Scheme language, a dialect of Lisp, which is the oldest programming language that is still recruiting new users today. Lisp and Python are similar in many ways. In fact, Lisp popularized many of the features that make Python a great language. Our choice to change languages is primarily motivated by the strength of Python's programming community, which you will soon join as you learn the language. Python also has excellent library support for a vast range of application areas. Knowing Python will help you pursue your future programming interests, wherever they may lead you.
